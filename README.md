# So_Long_42_Paris

Cool project of a little video game, I liked so much doing it !
The bonus part is the same as the mandatory one, except it has animation.
I am proud to say that I drew all sprites.
You'll need to check the README from the Minilibx to know the requirements here: https://github.com/Litkorn/So_Long_42_Paris/tree/main/bonus/mlx
